### ok but like... who am i really?

- probably overthinking something rn  
- if it compiles, i get butterflies  
- lives in the terminal, sleeps in oversized hoodies  
- has 12 unfinished projects and 0 regrets  
- talks sweet, writes code that bites (๑•﹏•)

### current mood
```sh
tmux a || tea && stare at the void
